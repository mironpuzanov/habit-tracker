You need to run this SQL command in your Supabase SQL Editor to create the "avatars" storage bucket:

INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) VALUES (\"avatars\", \"avatars\", true) ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

AND then these policies:

CREATE POLICY \"Avatar images are publicly accessible.\" ON storage.objects FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = \"avatars\");
CREATE POLICY \"Users can upload their own avatar.\" ON storage.objects FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = \"avatars\" AND auth.uid() = owner);
CREATE POLICY \"Users can update their own avatar.\" ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE USING (bucket_id = \"avatars\" AND auth.uid() = owner);
CREATE POLICY \"Users can delete their own avatar.\" ON storage.objects FOR DELETE USING (bucket_id = \"avatars\" AND auth.uid() = owner);
